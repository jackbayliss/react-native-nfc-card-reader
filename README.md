# react-native-nfc-card-reader

## Description 
This package is specifically designed to scan credit/debit cards using an Android devices NFC reader and return the card number, expiry and card type.

This package will only work on Android and isn't available for iOS as of 2020  because Apple do not allow 3rd party iPhone apps to use the Core NFC framework.
## Getting started

`$ npm install react-native-nfc-card-reader --save`
### For Gradle 7.0 and greater you can do:
`npm install "https://github.com/veyselkoru/react-native-nfc-card-reader.git#gradle7.0" --save`
### Mostly automatic installation

`$ react-native link react-native-nfc-card-reader`

## Usage
```javascript
import NfcCardReader from 'react-native-nfc-card-reader';

NfcCardReader.startNfc(function(cardDetails){
     // Card details contain the callback data below, see the options.
     that.setState({cardNumber : cardDetails.cardNumber})
     that.setState({expiryDate : cardDetails.expiryDate})
     that.setState({cardType : cardDetails.cardType})
 })
```
Ensure you add the following to your `AndroidManifest.xml` located in `android\app\src\main`

I am by no means an Android developer, but saw this as a huge thing no one had produced for React Native. So, if you can expand or improve on my basic implementation feel free to create a pull request.
